# Predict React
Because React is better than Angular!

## Installation
This is a standard npm project. For local development, the companion server [mcs-go](https://github.com/TKasekamp/mcs-go) should be used. If GO is too scary, change some conf to use the Heroku server in `constants.js`.
## Thanks to
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
